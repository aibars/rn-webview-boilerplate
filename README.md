# rn-webview-boilerplate
A simple React Native project to test WebViews integrations between the app's state


### Initialization

Install the necessary packages by typing `yarn install` and then to run the application just do `yarn start` in your console. This will start an Expo server. Once the server finished to load, type either `i` or `a` depending on whether you want to run an iOS simulator or an Android emulator. 
You can also install the Expo Go app in both Android or iPhone devices and then scan the generated QR Code with you camera. This will allow you to test the app on a physical device.
